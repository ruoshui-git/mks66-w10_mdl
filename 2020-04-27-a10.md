(MDL actually stands for Motion Description Language)

* Before doing anything else, take a look at MDL.spec, it provides important information about the language structure.
* There are many commands and features in MDL that we will not be using yet, you should ignore those for now.

__Implement the following mdl commands:__
  * push
    * push a copy of the current top of the origins stack onto the origins stack (a full copy, not just a reference to the current top)
  * pop
    * removes the top of the origins stack (nothing needs to be done with this data)
  * move/rotate/scale
    * create a translation/rotation/scale matrix and multiply the current top by it
    * do not try to use the optional arguments for these commands
  * box/sphere/torus
    * add a box/sphere/torus to a temporary polygon matrix, multiply it by the current top and draw it to the screen
    * if a constants variable is present, use those for lighting, otherwise, use a default set.
    * ignore the optional variable at the end of the command.
  * constants
    * you actually don't need to do anything for this command, the semantic analyzer will already create a symbol table entry for the reflective constants.
  * line
    * add a line to a temporary edge matrix, multiply it by the current top and draw it to the screen
    * do not try to use the optional arguments for this command
  * save
    * save the screen to the provided file name
  * display
    * show the image

* You only need to modify one of the following files (c/python):
  * C
    * my_main.c
    * look at print_pcode.c, it is an ideal template to follow for my_main.c
    * mdl.y: there is a comment at the very bottom that you will need to check.
  * Python
    * script.py
